# Home Assistant Voice Preview Edition (HAVPE) - Living Room
#
# This is a minimal *wrapper* config that pulls the upstream, hardware-correct
# firmware maintained by ESPHome/Home Assistant, then overrides only the parts
# that must be unique per device (name/friendly_name).
#
# Upstream firmware repo:
#   https://github.com/esphome/home-assistant-voice-pe
#
# Notes:
# - The upstream config includes the correct pin mapping and required external
#   components for the Voice Preview Edition (XMOS voice kit, mic array, LED ring,
#   dial, etc.).
# - It uses on-device microWakeWord (default models include "okay_nabu", "hey_jarvis",
#   and "hey_mycroft"). A custom "Computer" wake word would require training and
#   adding a microWakeWord model.
# - The upstream config intentionally supports provisioning (Improv/BLE) and does
#   not require embedding WiFi credentials in this YAML.
