# LCARS Computer - Home Assistant Groups
#
# Groups organize entities into logical collections for collective control.
# The LLM can reference these groups to control multiple devices with a
# single command (e.g., "Turn off all lights" or "Lock all doors").
#
# Groups appear as entities themselves, allowing automations and scripts
# to target them directly rather than listing individual entities.
