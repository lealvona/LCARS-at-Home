# LCARS Computer - Home Assistant Scenes
#
# Scenes define preset configurations for multiple entities that can be
# activated with a single command. The LCARS Computer can activate these
# scenes by name, enabling natural language commands like "Make it cozy"
# or "Movie time".
#
# Each scene captures the desired state of lights, climate, and other
# entities. When activated, all entities transition to their defined states.
